\textit{Research Notes of the \href{https://aas.org}{American Astronomical Society}}
(\href{http://rnaas.aas.org}{RNAAS}) is a publication in the AAS portfolio
(alongside ApJ, AJ, ApJ Supplements, and ApJ Letters) through which authors can 
promptly and briefly share materials of interest with the astronomical community
in a form that will be searchable via ADS and permanently archived.

The astronomical community has long faced a challenge in disseminating
information that may not meet the criteria for a traditional journal article.
There have generally been few options available for sharing works in progress,
comments and clarifications, null results, and timely reports of observations
(such as the spectrum of a supernova), as well as results that wouldnâ€™t
traditionally merit a full paper (such as the discovery of a single exoplanet
or contributions to the monitoring of variable sources). 

Launched in 2017, RNAAS was developed as a supported and long-term
communication channel for results such as these that would otherwise be
difficult to broadly disseminate to the professional community and persistently
archive for future reference.

Submissions to RNAAS should be brief communications - 1,000 words or fewer
\footnote{An easy way to count the number of words in a Research Note is to use
the \texttt{texcount} utility installed with most \latex\ installations. The
call  \texttt{texcount -incbib -v3 rnaas.tex}) gives 57 words in the front
matter and 493 words in the text/references/captions of this template. Another
option is by copying the words into MS/Word, and using ``Word Count'' under the
Tool tab.}, and no more than a single figure (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:1}) or table
(but not both) - and should be written in a style similar to that of a
traditional journal article, including references, where appropriate, but not
including an abstract.

Unlike the other journals in the AAS portfolio, RNAAS publications are not
peer reviewed; they are, however, reviewed by an editor for appropriateness
and format before publication. If accepted, RNAAS submissions are typically
published within 72 hours of manuscript receipt. Each RNAAS article is
issued a DOI and indexed by ADS \citep{2000A&AS..143...41K} to create a
long-term, citable record of work.

Articles can be submitted in \latex\ (preferably with the new "RNAAS"
style option in AASTeX v6.2), MS/Word, or via the direct submission in the
\href{http://www.authorea.com}{Authorea} or
\href{http://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} online collaborative editors.

Authors are expected to follow the AAS's ethics \citep{2006ApJ...652..847K},
including guidance on plagiarism \citep{2012AAS...21920404V}.
